A comprehensive parking management system for residential buildings.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Backend Setup (On UBC Server)

1. Change .env under backend folder
2. Upload the backend folder to the server
3. SSH into the server:

```bash
ssh yourCWL@remote.students.cs.ubc.ca
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/backend
```

3. Start the backend server:

```bash
sh ./remote-start.sh
```

**Keep this terminal window open to maintain the server connection.**

### Frontend Setup (On Local Machine)

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Open another terminal window and set up SSH tunnel:

```bash
sh ./scripts/mac/server-tunnel.sh
```

4. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

When prompted:

- Enter the remote port number (from step 3 of backend setup, e.g., 50020)
- Enter your CWL username

5. Keep both terminal windows open:

- One for the frontend server
- One for the SSH tunnel

### Access the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

2. Use the test accounts to log in:

- Administrator: admin@test.com / password
- Resident: resident@test.com / password

## Notes

- Keep the SSH tunnel and backend server running while developing
- The backend server runs on the school server
- The frontend development server runs locally
- All API requests are proxied through the SSH tunnel
